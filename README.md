# Rbioconductor-
Projects using R BioConductor
This is a set of projects I used to exhibit my knowledge of R/Bioconductor.
Most of the codes will be very explanatory and pedantic. This is to ensure that I know what I am doing and why I am doing it. 

Please let me know if there are any issues with this code.
